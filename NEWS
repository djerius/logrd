  [ BUG FIX ]

    * version 0.03 broke environment variables

0.03 : 2017-02-27T16:54:16-0500

  [ API CHANGE ]

    * options should not be passed to logrd when sourcing it, e.g.

        source logrd.bash --copy-to-console

      will now do nothing.  use the logrd-setup function instead.  I
      misunderstood what happend if no arguments were passed.  In that
      case the positional parameters were inherited from the calling
      script, which confused logrd.bash to no end.
